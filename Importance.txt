Importance and benefits
Nanotechnology provides many benefits in many areas of life, it helps to improve many technological and industrial sectors to a large extent, such as information technology, energy, medicine, national security, environmental science, food safety, and many others. Nanotechnology also adapts material structures at very small scales to achieve specific properties, through which they can strengthen the effectiveness of materials, while being lightweight, more durable, reactive and entangled.
