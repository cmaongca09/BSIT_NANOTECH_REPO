Summary
 The nanotechnology is a type of technology in computer industry which helps a lot of things in a lot
fields not just in electronic or technology industry but to all other fields like medicine, environment, food and more.
Nanotechnology implies to these field because they are the one who can help manage these things specially
on the environment of the world these days which are surrounded by technology no matter the size is and this
nanotechnology is one of the keys of the bright and high technology of the future and the living of the humans
in the world. Nanotechnology helps other things said earlier because they can replace some works for humans
to do themselves and make the job faster and much efficient. Also nanotechnology creates a way to some bright
ideas to come up in the brain to think more ways to expand the nanotechnology help to these fields and to
make life much more efficient than ever. Nanotechnology said to be one of the raw material that can help
anyone no matter what the fields in the industry are to think on how they can expand or make their field more
advanced with the help of this nanotechnology because with nanotechnology, they can rely on being more
efficient, much faster work, much accurate work, and much cheaper job to be done with just a tiny piece of
electronics.
