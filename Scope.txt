Explore the impact of nanotechnology extends from its medical, ethical, mental, legal, and environmental 
applications to fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, computing, materials science, and 
communications. Major benefits of nanotechnology include improved manufacturing methods, water 
purification systems, energy systems, physical enhancement, nanomedicine, better food production methods, 
nutrition, and large-scale infrastructure auto-fabrication. Nanotechnology's reduced size may allow for 
automation of tasks which were previously inaccessible due to physical restrictions, which in turn may reduce 
labor, land, or maintenance requirements placed on humans.
