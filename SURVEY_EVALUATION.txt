Survey and Technology Evaluation
	This article discusses the commercialization of nanotechnology among academic researchers in the
Finnish nanotechnology community. This survey-based study among academic researchers in the Finnish
nanotechnology community explores the significance of nanotechnology, how it compares to information
and communications technology, as well as the specific goals, difficulties, and effects that emerge during its
commercialization. It also highlights the significance of Richard Feynman's address, stressing the enthusiasm
and ground-breaking microscope developments that gave rise to nanotechnology.

	Understanding the need from the private sector is necessary for the commercialization of
nanotechnology. Surveying private businesses and organizations can yield useful data about their present
use of nanotechnology, their implementation plans for the future, and the areas where nanotechnology can
result in significant improvements. This can aid in the successful coordination of the efforts and resources of
industry executives, policymakers, and researchers to satisfy the demands of the private sector. Long-term
viewpoints, new trends, and foreseeing demands in the future should all be considered.
