Literature Review and supporting information
 Observation
	The knowledge and control of matter at the nanoscale describe nanotechnology, which has
emerged as a promising topic with significant economic development potential in the twenty-first century.
Because of its revolutionary character, scholars have compared its influence on that of information and
communications technology. However, the commercialization of nanotechnology raises goals, difficulties,
and effects that demand investigation. Based on a survey of academic researchers in the Finnish
nanotechnology community, this essay explores many issues of commercializing nanotechnology. The
research offers insight on the distinctive motivations, relationships, challenges, and outcomes associated with
people intensively involved in nanotechnology research compared to researchers in other disciplines by
examining individual-level survey data.


	According to Richard Feynman's key lecture from 1959, which pushed for investigating nanoscale
phenomena, the enthusiasm around nanotechnology is a trigger for this. In addition to the predominate focus
on large-scale scientific activities, his idea that there is "plenty of room at the bottom" led scientists to turn
their attention to the complexities of the nanoscale. Nanotechnology was further advanced by the
introduction of ground-breaking microscopy advancements like the scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
and atomic force microscope (AFM) in the early 1980s.
Nanotechnology is the study and manipulation of matter at the nanoscale, or one billionth of a meter,
scale. It involves manipulating, measuring, modeling, and visualizing matter at this scale, requiring
multidisciplinary expertise from physics and chemistry subfields. The top-down and bottom-up
methodological methods are the two main ones, with the former being more common. The bottom-up
strategy still has some challenges to overcome, though. An examination of the private sector's demand for
this potentially revolutionary technology is necessary due to nanotechnology's radical and gradual qualities.

 Literature Review
Scientists are looking at methods to increase the availability of safe, affordable, and renewable
energy sources, as well as ways to cut down on energy use and lessen environmental damage.
Nanotechnology solar panel studies are more successful in converting sunlight into electricity, and
nanostructured solar cells may be produced using techniques like printing and assembled into small sheets.
Energy efficiency products are increasing, such as more efficient lighting systems with considerably lower
power consumption, lighter and stronger transport chassis materials, low energy use in advanced electronics,
low-friction nano mastic lubricants, pumps, and fans, and high-light strength and fast recharge lanterns for
emergency crews. Nanotechnology has a variety of applications in the environment, including tools for
detecting and eliminating hazardous chemicals from contaminated water sources. It has the potential to
significantly improve the personalization, usability, cost-effectiveness, dependability, and simplicity of a wide
range of medical and biotechnological tools and procedures.
Early-detection molecular imaging makes use of nanoscale components to detect and record
genetic and molecular occurrences, allowing for variation of molecular signals associated with malignancy.
Nanoparticles are used in multifunctional treatment to deliver effective medication to cancer cells while
reducing the harm to healthy tissue.
Medical operations and therapies have been changed by nanotechnology, becoming more
specialized, compact, straightforward, healthier, and simpler to carry out. Quantum dots, which help improve
biological imaging in medical diagnostics, are semiconductor nanocrystals. Nanoscale sensors can detect
cell and molecule movements while they are in their environment, and microfluidic chip-based nanolabs can
manipulate and control individual cells. Research is being done on nanotechnology to help nerve cells
proliferate, for example, in damaged spinal cord or brain cells. In one way, a nanostructured gel bridges the
space between a cell's existing neighbors and encourages the growth of new ones.
